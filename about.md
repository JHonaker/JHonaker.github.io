## Who am I?

My name is John Honaker. To put it simply I'm a student. I have always been (and I always will be) a student. What I'm studying depends on when and where you catch me, but my one true love (other than my wife) is mathematics. I have an undergraduate BS in math, and I'm currently a graduate student studying statistics/biostatistics. Hopefully, soon I'll be working my way toward a PhD. 

I enjoy teaching myself an assortment of useful and useless skills in my spare time. Somewhere along the way, I picked up programming. These are the languages I'm familiar with:

* R and Python (which I'll use primarily for this blog)
* SAS
* C
* JavaScript
* SQL (call it what you will, but some dialects [are Turing complete](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/900055/is-sql-or-even-tsql-turing-complete))

## Contact Me

I love learning things, teaching things, building things, and I love talking to people about things they've built. If you have any questions or comments drop me a line at [TheXBarBlog at gmail dot com](TheXBarBlog@gmail.com).
