# What's this blog about?

This blog is simply a place for me to put some of the more coherent thoughts I have into words. I love math, statistics, and programming. I think about them pretty much all day, every day. I often find myself captivated by a problem or find some cool, new trick or idea. I like to share these things, but often I don't have a place I can do anything more than mention to someone in passing, "Hey, isn't this neat!"

This blog was created to give me a place to practice writing and share things that I find interesting or entertaining.

### What I'll be writing about

I'm a graduate student in biostatistics (which is just a fancy, more confusing word for statistics typically applied to some medical or public health problem) so there will definitely be a heavy emphasis on math and statistics. I write a lot of code for analyses for work. I enjoy programming in my free time too, so there will also be a focus on programming from both a statistical and general perspective. 

My current interests, and most likely subject of posts will be one or more of these:

* Machine Learning/Statistical Learning
* Programming
    * General practices and ideas (e.g. OOP and functional programming idioms)
    * Statistical applications (e.g. Basics of simulation studies, How-To for R packages)
* Interesting mathematical concepts and questions
* Statistical analysis of games
    * I like to look for dominant strategies in games that I play, and I also like to study things like the effect of skill in games with a large element of randomness/non-randomness.
* Other random interests that may not have anything to do with this stuff


Hopefully someone other than me will get something out of reading this site. If you do, please drop me a line [here](mailto:TheXBarBlog@gmail.com).
